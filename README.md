# NBA Standings Scraping

## Description
The project involves utilizing the NBA API through the RapidAPI service to retrieve and visualize season standings for NBA teams. The script, written in Python, incorporates the Matplotlib library for data visualization.The project exhibits a well-organized structure, employing separate functions for API requests (using the request module), data extraction and placing of them in lists, and visualization.

## Plots
The Matplotlib library is then employed to create grouped bar charts, visually representing the number of wins and losses for each NBA team. The use of distinct colors for wins and losses enhances the visual clarity of the charts. The script includes labeling for the x-axis and y-axis, set titles for each chart, and customization for improved aesthetics.

## More specific details
Additionally, the project appropriately separates the visualization into two charts, distinguishing between the Eastern and Western Conferences. This design choice provides a comprehensive view of team performance within each conference.

## Closing
In summary, the project effectively combines API integration, data processing, and visualization to present NBA team standings in a clear and engaging manner.
